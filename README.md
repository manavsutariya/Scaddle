# Quora Clone

Quora is a well question forum which has millions of users, and questions, answers and posts on 
almost every topic in the world covering nearly every question. Such forums can provide easy 
access to information which is either not readily available or if available is hard to comprehend. 

In this project, we have attempted to recreate this forum website as a web application to better 
understand the working of a real-world entity implementing both the front end and the back end 
part to learn to implement these technologies for a project trying to make as less difference in our 
clone as possible.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Bootstrap
- PHP
- MySQLi

### Tools used

- VS Code
- Git and GitHub
- XAMPP Server
- PHP Mailer
- MySQL database

### Features

The specific options that we will be provided in our application are: 
- Register as a new user
- Login into the application
- Read other people’s questions
- Choose from a variety of topics
- Post a question yourself, attach an image if required
- Answer your peer’s questions
- Manage your profile details
- Contact us in case of any problems

### Future Scope

The application is still in early stages, it can be customized according to usage. We plan on hosting 
it as “Aste”, a platform for college students like us to post queries and answer and help out our 
peers efficiently. It can be hosted after adding further features like filtering questions by favorite 
categories, not allowing a repeated question, tagging an answer, enhancing the profile page like 
visiting another user, following them etc, allowing image addition in answers as well. We can also 
add posts which will be different from question in respect that they are providing information 
instead of asking them. We can also add the option of like and comment in questions and post and 
implement machine learning algorithms for better results and searches. After hosting it can be used 
for daily purposes to interact with our seniors or alumni or simply help out our classmates and 
juniors. This can also be used as a place for collaboration of like-minded people to meet and build 
projects and indulge into research with each other.
